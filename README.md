# A Star Visualizer
This program uses the A Star algorithm - F(x) = H(x) + G(x) - in which H(x) is a heuristic function to the end goal destination and G(x) is the distance from the start node to the current location. This visualizes the algorithm using color coded nodes to reach the end destination then displays the resultant path.
